# CSC111-Project-2-Movie-Recommendations
A movie recommendation algorithm built on the MovieLens dataset, created for CSC111 at the University of Toronto.

**NOTE:** The full dataset is too large to commit to the repository. As such, it must be downloaded manually (here)[https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/].
